First Data set: sentiment analysis
The Blog Authorship Corpus consists of collected posts of 19,320 bloggers which are gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. 
The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person.
In this dataset, each blog is presented as a separate file, 
the name of which indicates a blogger id and the blogger’s self-provided gender, age, industry, and astrological sign.

Third Dataset : Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset
The Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset contains product reviews taken from Amazon.com from 4 product types (domains) — kitchen, books, DVDs, and electronics. 
Here each domain has several thousand reviews, but the exact number varies by the domain. The reviews contain star ratings (1 to 5 stars) which can also 
be converted into binary labels.

Fifth Data Set : Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) - Speech recognition
 Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) is an open dataset which is a collection of a simple audio/speech dataset consisting 
 of recordings of spoken digits in WAV files at 8kHz. In this dataset, the recordings are trimmed so that they have near minimal silence at the beginnings and ends.

 Sixth DataSet : Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) -  Question & Answering Analysis
 Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset which consists of questions posed by the crowd-workers on 
 a set of Wikipedia articles. Here, the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or
 the question might be unanswerable. SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 new, unanswerable questions 
 written adversarially by crowd-workers to look similar to answerable ones.

	Nineth  Dataset :WordNet -  Text Classification
	WordNet is a large lexical database of English. This dataset superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. The main relation among words in WordNet is synonymy, as between the words shut and close or car and automobile. There’s a total of 117 000 synsets in WordNet,
	each of which is linked to other synsets by means of a small number of conceptual relations.

 Tenth : TIMIT - Speech Recognition
 TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus is designed to provide speech data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development
 and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. The dataset contains broadband recordings of 630 speakers of eight major dialects of American English, each reading ten phonetically rich sentences.
